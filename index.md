## Welcome!

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg"> -->

I'm Sophie (she/her), and I am a PhD student in Technology and Social Behavior at Northwestern University. I'm part of the [Creative Interfaces Research + Design Studio](https://creativeinterfaces.soc.northwestern.edu/) and advised by Prof. Duri Long.

My research lies in human-computer interaction, and my interests include AI literacy, data privacy, and online creative communities. Currently, I work with Prof. Long on developing museum exhibits that utilize embodied interaction and creative making to teach middle school-aged youth about AI. 

Before starting my PhD, I graduated with a joint BS/MS in Computer Science from Northwestern University in 2023. I have experience as a Software Engineering Intern at Lyft and RightHand Technologies. 

I spend most of my free time knitting and crocheting and connecting with other fibre artists over social media.

You can contact me at sophierollins2023@u.northwestern.edu.
